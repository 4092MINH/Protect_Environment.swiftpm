    "Plastic waste, sewage, noise, and over-tourism are polluting Ha Long Bay. Its diverse marine ecosystem, natural beauty, and the tourism industry are negatively impacted. Environmental protection efforts are underway, but stronger action is needed. The future of this World Heritage Site depends on it.",
    "Some tourists in Sapa still litter, disrespect local customs, haggle excessively, or engage in unsustainable tourism practices. This negatively impacts the environment, culture, and Sapa's tourism image. However, many tourists demonstrate responsible behavior and contribute positively. Raising overall awareness remains a long-term challenge.",
    "Vung Tau, with its busy port and oil and gas activities, faces the risk of oil spills polluting the marine environment. These spills, whether large or small, harm the ecosystem, impact the livelihoods of fishermen, and damage the tourism landscape. Oil spill response is complex, costly, and requires multi-agency coordination. Raising environmental awareness and investing in prevention and response technologies are crucial for protecting Vung Tau's waters."
